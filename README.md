# Bagel

A bagel is a donut chart used to display single key value with a color coded performance level indicator. It is theme-able, extensible and visually pleasing and is typically found in infographics and dashboards.

It is great for showing progress or performance (KPI) that can be quickly understood at a glance.

# Goals

The primary goals for this project is:

1. It can be easily wrapped within framework components like ReactJS, Angular and VueJS.
